=micros()=

==Description==
Returns the number of microseconds since the CIKU board began running the current program. This number will overflow (go back to zero), after approximately 70 minutes.<br>
Note: there are 1,000 microseconds in a millisecond and 1,000,000 microseconds in a second.

==Syntax==
micros()

==Parameters==
None.

==Returns==
Number of microseconds since the program started (unsigned long).

==Example==
{{{
unsigned long currentMicros = 0;
int interval = 100000;

void setup()
{
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); // sets the digital pin as output
}

void loop()
{
  unsigned long currentMicros = micros(); // read current millis
  if(currentMicros - currentMicros > interval) // after 100ms
  {
    currentMicros = currentMicros;
    digitalToggle(LED); // toggle LED state
  }
}
